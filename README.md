*This is an app with a humorous purpose. It generates sentances formed from randomly selected words.*

## Solution

*The **Generator** is based on the following model:*

+ [Sentence] = `Who` + `Action` + `Details`.
    + **Who** = `First Name` + `Last Name` from `Place`
      + First Names = {Peter, Anne, Linda, Marie, Terrie, Rosy, Tsvety}
      + Last Names = {Smith, Wilson, Lee, Taylor, Baker, Evans, Allen}
      + Places = {Sofia, Veliko Tarnovo, Ruse, Varna, Stara Zagora, Pleven}
    + **Action** = `Adverb` +  `Verb` + `Adjective` + `Noun`
      + Adverbs = {calmly, sadly, slowly, warmly, dizzily}
      + Verbs = {takes, drinks, eats, plays with, runs, works}
      + Adjectives = {big, small, old, important, same, new}
      + Nouns = {phone, cup, watch, computer, paper, camera}
    + **Details** = {at the beach, near the river, at work, at home}
